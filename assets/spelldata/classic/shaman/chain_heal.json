The more Healing Power you have, the more efficient <b class='yellow'>Rank 1</b> becomes relative to <b class='yellow'>Max rank</b>. A well-geared Resto Shaman can use <b class='yellow'>Rank 1</b> more often than an intro-geared Resto Shaman. The curious result is that a well-geared Shaman consumes less mana/sec while providing greater throughput."
